## Objectives

This course  introduces participants to linux container,  docker and open container eco system . Its intended to  help  participants to get started using docker to build,  package  and run applications.

## Who is this for ?
This course is intended for anyone who is part of the software delivery process and would like to get started using docker in their workflows to build, ship and run applications with containers.

This includes developers, qa and ops  professionals alike who are part of the software delivery process either as part of developing applications, creating  tests or part of the ops team in charge of deploying applications or automation team which enables developers to create their workflows.  

## Who is this not for ?

  * If you are a advanced user of docker already, this course is definitely not for you.
  * If you already know the fundamentals of docker, mainly the concepts listed below,  but would like to know advanced concepts, you may want to enroll for Docker Advanced course instead.
  * If you are interested in learning docker on windows, this course is not ideal for you as it focuses on linux containers, even though docker is now supported on windows.


## What will you do as part of this course ?

As part of this course you will,  

   * Learn what linux containers are, what is docker and get an overview of  open container eco system.
   * Setup a local docker development environment
   * Launch containers, publish ports and connect to the applications running inside containers
   * Learn basic container operations and troubleshooting
   * Build docker images with best practices for  web application, create optimal dockerfiles
   * Learn single host container networking and volumes primitives.
   * Launch multi container application stacks with interlinked application.
   * Create specifications for setting up automated development environments with Docker Compose
   * Get a quick overview of Container Orchestration Engine (COE) functionality with Kubernetes/SWARM.

## What is not covered ?

Since this course is a beginner level, its not meant to cover advanced concepts such as,

  * Advanced Container Orchestration
  * Container Security
  * Logging and Monitoring setup for container based systems
  * Multi Host Networking/Overlay/CNI
  * Writing Micro Services Applications
  * Customising Docker Installation and Setup
  * Production grade docker setup and deployment
  * Custom registries, base images etc.
  * Cloud Integrations
  * Network storage and persistence


## Pre Requisites

Following are the pre requisite skills to attend this course. Since its a beginner level course, no prior experience with linux containers is assumed.
