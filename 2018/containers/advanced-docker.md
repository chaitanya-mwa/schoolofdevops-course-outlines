## Objectives

This course follows a hands on  workshop method and builds advanced docker skills on top of existing skills learnt in Docker Fundamentals.

## Who is this for ?

This course is for someone who has already taken docker fundamentals course and would like to learn advanced topics such as how to integrate docker into developement and continuous integration workflows, how to add security while building as well as running container systems, how to create custom base images, registries  etc. as well as setting up auxiliary services such as monitoring and centralized logging for container systems.


## Who is this not for ?

  * If you are a advanced user of docker already, this course is definitely not for you.
  * If you are interested in learning docker on windows, this course is not ideal for you as it focuses on linux containers, even though docker is now supported on windows.
  * If you have already taken Docker Fundamentals, and interested in learning container orchestration and production deployments, you may want to consider **Kubernetes Bootcamp** instead.


## What will you do as part of this course ?

As part of this course you will,  

   * Install and configure docker by hand on a generic linux os, setup certificates  and connect to it from a remote client.
   * Learn about best practices and methods that you could incorporate to use docker for packaging as well as testing applications.
   * Learn to create your own custom **base images** instead of using parent images from the registry/third party.
   * Create a custom registry using **Harbor**, setup users and access and incorporate it into your workflow.
   * Incorporate security best practices while building and distributing docker images.
   * Learn how to run **docker bench** security scan and enhance run time security.
   * Integrate docker with jenkins to setup **continuous integration** environment for micro services based application.

## What is not covered ?

Since this course is a beginner level, its not meant to cover advanced concepts such as,

  * Advanced Container Orchestration
  * Multi Host Networking/Overlay/CNI
  * Writing Micro Services Applications
  * Production grade docker setup and deployment
  * Cloud Integrations
