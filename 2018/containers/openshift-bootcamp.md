## Objectives

This course serves as a accelerator program to understand, setup and master openshift container platform for professionals who already have an understanding of docker and kubernetes.

## Who is this for ?

  * This course is for someone who has already taken docker fundamentals, and kubernetes bootcamp  courses/have equivalent knowledge, and would like to learn how to leverage **Openshift Platform** which is an abstraction on top of it.
  * If you are a **Operations/Systems** personnel and would like to learn how to build a production grade scalable, fault tolerant and high available openshift infrastructure, and administer it,  this course it for you.
  * If you are a **developer** and would like to learn how to deploy your application stacks in production, on top of paas solution and also understand the underlying primitives,  this course is for you.
  * You could be developer/operations personnel and be in charge of securing application infrastructure and setup auxiliary services such as  monitoring, centralized  logging etc. this course is for you.

## Who is this not for ?

  * If you are a **advanced user of Openshift** already, this course is definitely not for you.
  * If you are interested in learning docker/container orchestration on **windows**, this course is not ideal for you as it focuses on linux containers.
  * This is mix course for both developers and operations. If you are looking for a course which is very specific to an audience e.g.  administrators or developers, ask for a custom outline.

## What will you do as part of this course ?

As part of this course you will,  

   * GO through the theory to learn what is openshift platform, the core concepts relates and the advantages of using it.
   * Install and configure a simple(non HA) multi node Openshift cluster  with **ansible**. You would also have a conceptual understanding of  how to build a production quality cluster with high availability, scalability,  redundancy and  security considerations.
   * Learn how to deploy, configure, interconnect and publish and scale applications as well as isolate those with multi tenant environments that openshift provides and underlying kubernetes primitives that it leverages.  
   * Achieve  **Continuous Integration and Delivery** with openshift's integration with git, jenkins and its implicit primitives including builds, pipelines and image streams.  
   * Learn how to manage **persistent storage** in a openshift environment
   * Learn about the network and security considerations and features offered by Openshift.
   * Learn openshift **administration** tasks such as setting up quotas, managing memberships, monitoring etc.

## What is not covered ?

Even though this course covers many concepts related to kubernetes, since its a very vast topic, it still has the following areas uncovered.

  * Cloud specific provisioning and integration
  * HA installation  of a kubernetes cluster with multi masters
  * In depth openshift administration
  * Writing Micro Services Applications
  * Alternate container runtimes e.g. rocker/rkt, runc
